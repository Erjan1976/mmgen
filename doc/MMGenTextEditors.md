### A word on text editors:

The text file editors that come with Windows, "edit" and "notepad", are
unsuitable for editing source code for many reasons, but above all because they
don't handle the line endings in Unix text files properly.  Therefore, you'll
need to install a Unix-capable text editor such as nano or Vim.

[Nano][00] is an easy-to-use editor designed for less experienced users.  It's
available [here][04] as a precompiled Windows binary.  Just extract `nano.exe`
from the archive and copy it to your path.

For advanced users with some knowledge of vi commands, [Vim][01], a full-featured
editor with advanced text highlighting capabilities, will be a better choice.
Grab the Windows installer [here][05] and run it, accepting the defaults.

After installing Vim, you should add its executable directory `C:\Program
Files\Vim\vim74` (your version number may be different) to your user path.
Editing user paths is explained [here][06].
