### Editing the user path in Windows:

  1. Right-click on your "My Computer" icon and select "Properties".
  2. Click on the "Advanced" tab, then on the "Environment Variables" button.
  3. A dialogue window will pop up.  Edit the path variable in the **top** text
	 box, adding your entry (`c:\mingw\bin`, for example) to the end.  If there
	 is no PATH variable listed there, create it.  Path entries are separated
	 by semicolons in Windows, so if the PATH variable already exists and has
	 entries, you must separate your entry from the preceding one with a
	 semicolon.  As a guide for the format, you may examine the **system** PATH
	 variable in the **bottom** text box.  **Do not** edit the system PATH,
	 however, as this can lead to unintended consequences for your computer.
