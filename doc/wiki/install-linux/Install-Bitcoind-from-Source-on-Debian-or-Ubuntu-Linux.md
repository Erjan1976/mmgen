Make sure that the following development packages for the boost library are
installed (package names may vary; the version should be 1.48 or greater, and
version 1.54 on Ubuntu 13.10 is reported not to work):

		libboost-system-dev
		libboost-filesystem-dev
		libboost-program-options-dev
		libboost-chrono-dev
		libboost-test-dev
		libboost-thread-dev

You'll also need the standard build tools such as automake, autoconf and
libtool, but these are probably already on your system if you've done any
compiling from source.

Clone the bitcoin repository from Github, configure, and build:

		$ git clone https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.git
		$ cd bitcoin
		$ ./autogen.sh
		$ ./configure --without-gui
		$ make -j4

If 'configure' complains about a missing libdb version 4.8, you have
two options: either install the libdb4.8-dev package or use the add the
'--with-incompatible-bdb' option to the 'configure' command line.  Be warned
that the latter option will result in your 'wallet.dat' files being incompatible
with the binary build of bitcoind.

Your freshly compiled daemon is now in the src/ directory.  Refer to **Run:** on
the [binary installation page][01] for running instructions.
