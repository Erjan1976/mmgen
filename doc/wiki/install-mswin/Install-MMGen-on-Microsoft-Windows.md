***Warning: though the MMGen installation process on Windows is now easier,
it still requires patience, and the user experience is less than optimal.
You're urged to use the prebuilt [MMGenLive][20] USB image instead.  It's now
the preferred way for all non-Linux users to run MMGen.***

Install MMGen on Windows by completing the following three steps:

>> 1. Install MinGW and MSYS ([WinXP][03]|[>=Win7][01]), if you haven't already;
>> 2. Install MMGen's dependencies (excluding the bitcoin daemons) and MMGen itself ([WinXP][04]|[>=Win7][02]); and
>> 3. [Install the offline and online bitcoin daemons (bitcoind)][07].

Congratulations, your MMGen installation is now complete!  Now you can
proceed to [**Getting Started with MMGen**][08].
