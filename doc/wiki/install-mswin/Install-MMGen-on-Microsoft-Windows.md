***Warning: the MMGen installation process on Windows is not for the faint of
heart, success is not guaranteed and the user experience is less than optimal.
You're urged to use the prebuilt [MMGenLive][00] USB image instead.  It's now
the preferred way for all non-Linux users to run MMGen.***

Install MMGen on Windows by completing the following three steps:

> 1. [Install MinGW and MSYS][01], if you haven't already;
> 2. [Install MMGen's dependencies (excluding the bitcoin daemons) and
>    MMGen itself][02]; and
> 3. [Install the offline and online bitcoin daemons (bitcoind)][07].

Congratulations, your MMGen installation is now complete!  Now move on to
[**Getting Started with MMGen**][08].
