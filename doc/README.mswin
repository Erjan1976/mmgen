MMGen MS Windows Notes

The following MMGen features are unsupported or broken on the MSWin/MinGW platform:

- Autosign (not supported)
- Zcash z-address generation (requires libsodium)
- Monero wallet creation/syncing* (IO stream issues with pexpect and the password prompt)
- UTF-8 label, filename and path support (may work on versions of Windows with native UTF-8 support)

*Monero address and viewkey generation works fine.
