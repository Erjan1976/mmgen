MMGen = Multi-Mode GENerator
----------------------------
##### a Bitcoin cold storage solution for the command line

### Download/Install on Microsoft Windows

  Compiling the watch-only bitcoind and the python scrypt module are the
  main challenges for Windows installation.
  To compile bitcoind, MinGW must first be installed
  and the Berkeley DB and Boost libraries built from source.
  The Python interpeter is required for building the python scrypt
  module and installing the other python modules.

  The build process involves some editing of source code and configuration
  files, so it's useful to have a good text editor installed on the system.

  MMGen's remaining components either require no compilation (the ecdsa and
  bitcoin-python modules and MMGen itself) or can be found online in
  precompiled form (the Python interpeter, pycrypto Python module and
  vanitygen)
