#  mmgen = Multi-Mode GENerator
## command-line Bitcoin cold storage solution

NOTE: For the time being, MMGen should be considered Alpha software.
Downloading and testing it out is easy, risk-free and encouraged.
However, spending significant amounts of BTC into your mmgen-generated
addresses is done at your own risk.

### Features:

> As with all deterministic wallets, mmgen can generate an unlimited number
> of address/key pairs from a single seed.  You back up your wallet only once.

> MMGen gives you four ways to access your Bitcoins:

>> 1) with a wallet encrypted with AES256 using the crack-resistant scrypt 
>> function to hash the password.  The wallet's password and hash
>> strength can be changed;

>> 2) with a one-line seed file (unencrypted);

>> 3) with an Electrum-like mnemonic of 12, 18 or 24 words; or

>> 4) with a brain password (recommended for expert users only).

> Furthermore, these methods can all be combined.  If you forget your
> Electrum-like mnemonic, for example, you can regenerate it and your
> keys from a stored wallet or seed.  Correspondingly, a lost wallet or
> seed can be recovered from the mnemonic.

> The wallet and seed are short, simple text files suitable for printing
> or even writing out by hand.  The base-58-encoded seed is short enough
> to memorize, providing another brain storage alternative.

> Implemented as a suite of python scripts, MMGen is super-lightweight.
> Combined with bitcoind compiled with the watch-only address feature
> (see below), it provides a complete solution for securely storing
> Bitcoins offline and tracking and spending them online.


### Instructions for Linux/Unix:

### Download:
> `git clone https://github.com/mmgen/mmgen.git`

### Install:
>  Install the ecdsa, scrypt and pycrypto modules:

            sudo pip install ecdsa scrypt pycrypto

>  Install mmgen:

            cd mmgen; sudo ./setup.py install

>  Install vanitygen (optional but recommended):

            git clone https://github.com/samr7/vanitygen.git

            (build and put the 'keyconv' executable in your path)

### Getting Started:
> On your offline computer:

> Generate a wallet with a random seed:

            $ mmgen-walletgen
            ...
            Wallet saved to file '89ABCDEF-76543210[256,3].dat'


> "89ABCDEF" is the Seed ID; "76543210" is the Key ID.
> The Seed ID never changes and will be used to identify all
> keys/addresses generated by this wallet.
> The Key ID changes when the wallet's password or hash preset are changed.
> "256" is the seed length; "3" is the scrypt hash preset.
> These are configurable.


> Generate ten addresses with the wallet:

            $ mmgen-addrgen 89ABCDEF-76543210[256,3].dat 1-10
            ...
            Address data saved to file '89ABCDEF[1-10].addrs'


> Note that the address range, "1-10", is indicated in the filename.
> To generate addresses 1000 through 2000 (for example), specify
> "1000-2000" on the command line and the filename will be
> '89ABCDEF[1000-2000].addrs'

            $ cat '89ABCDEF[1-10].addrs'
            89ABCDEF {
              1     16bNmyYISiptuvJG3X7MPwiiS4HYvD7ksE
              2     1AmkUxrfy5dMrfmeYwTxLxfIswUCcpeysc
              3     1HgYCsfqYzIg7LVVfDTp7gYJocJEiDAy6N
              4     14Tu3z1tiexXDonNsFIkvzqutE5E3pTK8s
              5     1PeI55vtp2bX2uKDkAAR2c6ekHNYe4Hcq7
              6     1FEqfEsSILwXPfMvVvVuUovzTaaST62Mnf

              10    1H7vVTk4ejUbQXw45I6g5qvPBSe9bsjDqh
            }


> To store your Bitcoins, spend them into these addresses from whatever
> wallets/software you're currently using.  If you have lots of BTC,
> generate lots of addresses so that each address will have only a
> relatively small balance.

### Spending your stored coins:
> Take address 1 out of cold storage by generating a key for it:

            $ mmgen-keygen 89ABCDEF-76543210[256,3].dat 1
            ...
            Key data saved to file '89ABCDEF[1].akeys'

            $ cat 89ABCDEF[1].akeys
            89ABCDEF {
              1  sec:  5JCAfK1pjRoJgmpmd2HEMNwHxAzprGIXeQt8dz5qt3iLvU2KCbS
                 addr: 16bNmyYISiptuvJG3X7MPwiiS4HYvD7ksE
            }

> Save the \*.akeys file to a USB stick and transfer it to your online computer.

> On your online computer, import the secret key into
> a running bitcoind or bitcoin-qt:

            $ bitcoind importprivkey 5JCAfK1pjRoJgmpmd2HEMNwHxAzprGIXeQt8dz5qt3iLvU2KCbS

> That's all there is to it!

> OPTIONAL: To track balances without exposing secret keys on your
> online computer, download and compile sipa's bitcoind patched for
> watch-only addresses:

	        $ git clone https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin
            $ git branch mywatchonly remotes/origin/watchonly
            $ git checkout mywatchonly

            (build, install)

> Track the balances of the addresses in '89ABCDEF[1-10].addrs':

            $ bitcoind importaddress 16bNmyYISiptuvJG3X7MPwiiS4HYvD7ksE
            $ bitcoind importaddress 1AmkUxrfy5dMrfmeYwTxLxfIswUCcpeysc
            $ ...

### Using the mnemonic and seed features:

> Using our example above,

> Generate a mnemonic from the wallet:

            $ mmgen-walletchk -m '89ABCDEF-76543210[256,3].dat'
            ...
            Mnemonic data saved to file '89ABCDEF.words'

            $ cat 89ABCDEF.words
            pleasure tumble spider laughter many stumble secret bother
            after search float relationship path strong curtain savior
            worst suspend bright touch away dirty measure thorn

> Note: a 128-bit or 192-bit seed will generate a shorter mnemonic of 12
> or 18 words.  Generate a wallet with a shorter seed by using
> `mmgen-walletgen -l`.  Whether you consider 128 or 192 bytes of
> entropy to be enough is up to you.

> Generate addresses 1-11 using the mnemonic instead of the wallet:

            $ mmgen-addrgen -m 89ABCDEF.words 1-11
            ...
            Address data saved to file '89ABCDEF[1-11].addrs'

> Compare the first ten addresses with those earlier generated from the
> wallet.  You'll see they're the same.

> Recover a lost wallet using the mnemonic:

            $ mmgen-walletgen -m 89ABCDEF.words
            ...
            Wallet saved to file '89ABCDEF-01234567[256,3].dat'

> Note that the regenerated wallet has a different Key ID but
> of course the same Seed ID.

> Seeds are generated the same way as mnemonics.  Just change the
> '-m' option to '-s' in the preceding commands.

> A seed file for a 256-bit seed looks like this:

            $ cat 8B7392ED.mmseed
            f4c84b C5ZT wWpT Jsoi wRVw 2dm9 Aftd WLb8 FggQ eC8h Szjd da9L

> And for a 128-bit seed:

            $ cat 8E0DFB78.mmseed
            0fe02f XnyC NfPH piuW dQ2d nM47 VU

> The latter is short enough to be memorized or written down.

> The first word is a checksum.
> To check that you've written or memorized the seed correctly, take the
> first 3 bytes of a sha256 hash of the remainder of the line (with
> spaces removed).

#### Mnemonics and seeds â€” additional information:
> Mnemonic and seed data may be entered at the prompt instead of from a
> file.  Just omit the filename on the command line.

> Mnemonic and seed data may be printed to standard output instead of a
> file with `mmgen-walletchk -S`

> Mnemonic and seed files may be output to a directory besides the
> current one with `mmgen-walletchk -d`

> Bear in mind that mnemonic and seed data is unencrypted.  If it's
> compromised, your Bitcoins can easily be stolen.  Make sure no one's
> looking when you print mnemonic or seed data to screen.  Securely
> delete your mnemonic and seed files.  In Linux, you can achieve
> additional security by writing the files to volatile memory in
> '/dev/shm' instead of disk.

### Vanitygen note:
> When available, the 'keyconv' utility from the vanitygen package is
> used to generate addresses because it's much faster than the python
> ecdsa library.

### Test suite:
> To see what tests are available, run the scripts in the 'tests'
> directory without arguments.  Some of the more interesting tests to
> try:

                tests/bitcoin.py keyconv_compare_randloop 10
                tests/bitcoin.py hextob58_pad_randloop 1000
                tests/mnemonic.py random128
                tests/mnemonic.py random192
                tests/mnemonic.py random256
